[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/elixir-toolkit-theme.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/elixir-toolkit-theme) [![Jekyll site CI](https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/elixir-toolkit-theme/actions/workflows/jekyll.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/elixir-toolkit-theme/actions/workflows/jekyll.yml) 


Homepage for [oiseau-lab](https://github.com/oiseau-lab)'s GitHub Pages of the [research-notebooks repository](https://github.com/oiseau-lab/research-notebooks).

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that changes made to the [research-notebooks](https://github.com/oiseau-lab/research-notebooks) repository are now first made downstream in the [research-notebooks-dev](https://github.com/oiseau-lab/research-notebooks-dev) fork. For a changelog, interested parties would therefore be better off referring to the dev repo. This change was made to avoid 'breaking' the deployed webpage in the absence of complete local testing.

> [!TIP]
> If you wish to run the Jupyter notebook `PlotAndPageGenerationForInterviews.ipynb`, which is used to generate plots and define some of the site structure and formatting, you will be able to do so by setting up a conda :snake: environment by cloning the `environment.yml`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cloning or forking this repository, without modification, and activating Pages (i.e. automatically defining a sequence of Github Actions) will deploy the site. Like other Jekyll sites, to deploy the site locally, you can do so with Ruby using gems :gem: and bundler as detailed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll). :link:
